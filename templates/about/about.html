            <h3>LOVE CIBERSECURITY</h3>
            <p>I am currently 20 years old and embarking on an exciting journey as a first-year cybersecurity student at the University of Cuba, (UCI). My academic path is focused on three critical areas: Malware Analysis, Forensic Analysis, and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). Each of these fields plays a vital role in the broader landscape of cybersecurity, and I am eager to delve deeper into them. Malware Analysis is particularly intriguing to me as it involves the systematic examination of malicious software to understand its characteristics, behavior, and potential impact on systems. This process is essential for developing effective defenses against cyber threats. I am learning various techniques such as static and dynamic analysis, where static analysis allows me to inspect malware without executing it, while dynamic analysis involves running the malware in a controlled environment to observe its actions in real-time. Understanding these methodologies is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and developing strategies to mitigate risks associated with malware attacks. In addition to malware analysis, I am also studying Forensic Analysis, which focuses on investigating cyber incidents to uncover evidence of wrongdoing. This field combines technical skills with investigative techniques to analyze data breaches, track unauthorized access, and gather information that can be used in legal proceedings. As I learn about digital forensics, I am becoming familiar with the tools and processes necessary for recovering data, analyzing logs, and preserving evidence in a manner that is admissible in court. Furthermore, my interest in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is growing as it encompasses the collection and analysis of publicly available information to support cybersecurity efforts. OSINT involves leveraging various online resources, including social media, forums, and databases, to gather intelligence that can help identify potential threats or vulnerabilities. This skill is increasingly important in today's interconnected world, where attackers often exploit publicly accessible information. As I progress through my studies at UCI, I am committed to building a strong foundation in these areas. The knowledge and skills I acquire will not only prepare me for a successful career in cybersecurity but also empower me to contribute meaningfully to the ongoing battle against cyber threats. I look forward to engaging with my peers and instructors, participating in hands-on projects, and staying updated on the latest trends and technologies in this ever-evolving field.</p>
